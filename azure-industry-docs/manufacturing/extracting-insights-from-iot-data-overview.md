# Extracting actionable insights from IoT data

Manufacturers are looking at a modern factory floor with an eye to improving
production and processes using digital tools. And the greatest common
denominator is the Internet of Things (IoT). Machines have been emitting data
for some time now. New machines will doubtlessly be providing even more data.
But having the data is just the first step. Our solution guide provides a path
to using the data for actions such as predictive maintenance.

In brief, the solution focuses on three major steps: things (data), insights
(via advanced analytics) and actions.

Having data is great, but data is just raw materials. Insights through analysis
guides your actions.

The architecture is flexible and lets you ingest and analyze data at high
throughput. As your needs grow, the components can also scale up and down to
meet demand or save cost. The guide also shows you recommendations for
implementing the architectureâ€”for example, using Azure Event Hubs to ingest, and
Power BI for an analytics client.
